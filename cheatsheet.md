This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

1: enter a room in the mansion and obtain information from a character in the room (if applicable)
2: print out all gathered information learned about the case, which is dynamically updated as the character moves throughout the mansion
3: request a hint (which is based on the moves played so far) that reveals additional information about the suspects and the case
4: print out all of these commands and descriptions
5: accuse the character, room, and weapon, which effectively stops gameplay. If all accused information is correct, the player wins, and if any information is incorrect then they lose.

The layout of the game and all the rooms are identical to the layout of the classic board game Clue. Players can go to adjacent rooms or rooms connected with the traditional secret passage. Image is in map.jpg.

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
