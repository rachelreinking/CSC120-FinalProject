Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)

I designed this game as being based on a map where each of the nodes are the locations. The main method of the Game class is where gameplay occurs. Game has a dependency on Board, and Board aggregates Character, Room, and Weapon. The player is first instructed to choose a room to start, but after that they are free to use any commands in any order until they decide to accuse, which results in unique gameplay and discovery. I chose this because it was similar to how the Clue board game is actually played but also allowed for it to be elevated and there to be more mystery. I considered mandating the player enter all rooms before accusing or having the rollout of clues by more similar to how Clue is traditionally played, but I decided on a more freestyled approach to moves and a more rules for the player to have a more fun text-based video game experience. I also considered having the map not be graph based and instead more similar to the map I implemented for assignment 8, but the graph-based approach was honestly easier, more intuitive with how I set up my game, and it allowed me to learn some new skills.
